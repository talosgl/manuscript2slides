            ## Windows Binary Release

            Download `manuscript2slides-windows.zip` below.

            ### Installation
            1. Download and extract the ZIP file (recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/))
            2. Run `manuscript2slides.exe` from the extracted folder
            3. Windows may show a security warning - click "More info" > "Run anyway"
            4. No Python installation required

            ### (Optional) Verification
            **SHA256 Checksum:** `${{ steps.checksum.outputs.sha256 }}`

            To verify the download ([What are checksums?](https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/)):
            ```powershell
            Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 manuscript2slides-windows.zip
            ```

            Compare the output to the checksum above. They should match.

            ### Notes
            - Unsigned binary - Windows SmartScreen may warn you the app and its publisher are unknown. This is common with open source apps. Click "More Info" to get the option to "Run anyway."
            - ~100MB including full Python runtime
            - Keep all files in the extracted folder together
            - Tested on Windows 11
