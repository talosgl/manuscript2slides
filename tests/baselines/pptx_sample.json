Lecture, June 2020. https://hugohouse.org/store/class/we-you-i-experimenting-with-points-of-view-piper-lane/ — In this course, Piper Lane taught that an effective technique of writing the collective “we” point of view is “shimmering between bodies.” When you write the “we” point-of-view, there’s always risk of flattening that collective in a limiting way instead of communicating the expansive coalition. It is hard to feel close to the story without a body to be in. It can be hard to be interested in the story. The narrative drive is hard to pull off, too, since conflict is usually between individuals. Inhabiting individual bodies and then shimmering between them can ground the reader and help the narrative feel more dynamic. Another point Lane taught was that wherever there is a “we,” there is a chance there is a “they.”",

Lecture, June 2020. https://hugohouse.org/store/class/we-you-i-experimenting-with-points-of-view-piper-lane/ — In this course, Piper Lane taught that an effective technique of writing the collective “we” point of view is “shimmering between bodies.” When you write the “we” point-of-view, there’s always risk of flattening that collective in a limiting way instead of communicating the expansive coalition. It is hard to feel close to the story without a body to be in. It can be hard to be interested in the story. The narrative drive is hard to pull off, too, since conflict is usually between individuals. Inhabiting individual bodies and then shimmering between them can ground the reader and help the narrative feel more dynamic. Another point Lane taught was that wherever there is a “we,” there is a chance there is a “they.”",
